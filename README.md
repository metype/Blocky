# Blocky - A Puzzle Game
Blocky is currently in version **0.75**

### Concept
Blocky is a randomly generated maze-like game with a simple goal.
You start at the green tile and can move using WASD, your goal is to reach the red tile.
The catch is that once you start moving, you can't stop 'till you hit a wall.
